# What?
This repo is a simple compiler from a very simple lisp-like language supporting only the byte data type to Brain F*ck.

# Why?
Hahaha

# How?
python2 lisp.py < demo.lisp > demo.asm  # converts the simple lisp language to a simple stack based assembly language
python2 asm.py < demo.asm > demo.bf  # converts the stack based assembly language to Brain F*ck
